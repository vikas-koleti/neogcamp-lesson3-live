            <p>Ferruchio Lamborghini was born in a family of farmers. </p>
            <p>However, he had a big inclination towards mechanics and automobiles. In fact, during World War 2, he served in the airforce as a mechanic as well, but his story didn't begin until after the 2nd world war was over. He was very quick in identifying a business opportunity. While Europe was rebuilding itself from the damages of the war and broken economy, he realised that agriculture would be the driving force behind this and would be in great demand in the next few decades. He saw that market opportunity and started building tractors which could be used in So, the first Lamborghini ever was tractor. The tractor business took off and be became rich.</p>

            <p>Now, what did rich entrepreneurs do in the 50's? They bought sports cars and so did Ferruchio Lamborghini. One of the many sports cars that he bought was a Ferrari and he had a terrible time driving it. He took the car to the Ferrari factory multiple times and the issue was always the same, a clutch which was not upto the mark. Eventually, he got frustrated and tried fixing the clutch on his own in his own factory where he discovered a startling fact - the clutch used by Ferrari in their luxury sports car was the same clutch which was used by Lamborghini in their tractors. Expensive high-end Ferraris using the same clutch as low priced tractors. That’s like paying 10x for momos in a fancy restaurant just because they’re called steamed dumplings on the menu.</p>

            <p>This did not sit well with Ferruchio and he decided to go visit Enzo Ferrari himself. Imagine you're having some mechanical trouble with your Tesla and you decide to go complain to Elon Musk about it. The meeting as it turned out, went down in history. Lamborghini told Ferrari that he made beautiful cars but he made them with parts that he used in a tractor. Ferrari was livid and they had a verbal exchange, the script of which, many have speculated over the years. Enzo Ferrari apparently told Ferruchio Lamborghini that he could drive a tractor but he could never handle a sophisticated car like Ferrari.</p>

            <p>This verbal spat made Lamborghini so furious that he decided to create his own sports car just to get back at Ferrari and that gave birth to the popular Lamborghini sports cars that are so famous around the globe today. Five decades down the line, both brands are still on top of the game and it all started because of inflated egos.</p>
